# Concurrent Typing Game




## A few things to note:

1. After running the "make" command, all the necessary compilations of source files occurs.

2. Do not call "make run" because it does not allow you to pass command-line arguments in. Rather run the program by calling "java WordApp <totalWords> <noWords> <dictionary_file> from the bin directory. The game will then begin.

3. Ensure the dictionary file is in the bin directory.

4. Ensure the sound files are in the bin directory.

5. When running "make clean", the sound files will be removed from the bin directory. In order to run the code again, please copy and paste the sound files from "SoundFiles" back into the directory.
